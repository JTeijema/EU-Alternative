# Repository for the EU-alternative documentation

Europe through the ages has been the epicenter of innovation. However, most big tech is located and developed based in the US or China, outside of the (much needed) European regulations.

The EU Alternative is documenting European alternatives to foreign companies, both for Software and Hardware. We also document pro-european Websites.

It is inconvenient (and neigh impossible) to only use EU-based companies, but if a solid alternative is available, we aim to document it here. We promote EU built, open-source, GDPR compliant, and sustainable alternatives to help European companies compete with their non-European counterparts.

See [EU-Alternative.readthedocs.io](https://eu-alternative.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for the latest build.
