Welcome to the EU Alternative.
==============================

Europe through the ages has been the epicenter of innovation. However, most big
tech is located and developed based in the US or China, outside of the (much
needed) European regulations.

The **EU Alternative** is documenting European alternatives to foreign
companies, both for :doc:`software` and :doc:`hardware`. We also document
:doc:`EU-link`.

We Promote EU built, open-source, `GDPR <https://gdpr.eu/>`__ compliant, and
sustainable alternatives to foreign companies.

This site is based on `evropean.eu/ <https://www.evropean.eu/about>`__.
Check :doc:`about` for more information.
