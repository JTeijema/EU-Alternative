Welcome to the EU Alternative.
==============================

Europe through the ages has been the epicenter of innovation. However, most big
tech is located and developed based in the US or China, outside of the (much
needed) European regulations.

The **EU Alternative** is documenting European alternatives to foreign
companies, both for :doc:`software` and :doc:`hardware`. We also document
Pro-:doc:`EU-link`.

It is *inconvenient* (and neigh *impossible*) to only use EU-based companies, but
if a solid alternative is available, it is documented here. We Promote EU built,
open-source, `GDPR <https://gdpr.eu/>`__ compliant, and sustainable alternatives
to help European companies compete with their non-European counterparts.

This site is based on `evropean.eu/ <https://www.evropean.eu/about>`__.
Check :doc:`about` for more information.
